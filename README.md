# Library Management System

1. Book Management: - Update the database of the library with new books.
   - Modify the information already available about books - Eliminate books from the library database

2. Borrower Management: - Enter new borrowers' names, contact information, and membership IDs into the library system.
   Removing borrowers from the system; updating borrower information

3. Book Borrowing and Returning: - Provide book details to borrowers along with their membership ID to enable book borrowing.
   - Keep track of each borrowed book's due date and deal with past-due books.
   Provide a way for borrowers to return books, and make the necessary updates to the database.

4. Book Search and Availability: - Make sure users can locate books by author, title, or genre by offering a search function.
   - Display the quantity of copies that are available for each book.

5. Fine Calculation: Using pre-established guidelines, compute and oversee fines for overdue book returns.
   - When books are returned after the due date, fines are immediately updated.

6. Database Connectivity: - Create a connection between the MySQL database and the Python program.
   - Make the necessary database tables to hold information about books, borrowers, transactions, and fines.
   - For smooth data management, put CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) procedures into practice.

7. Security and Validation: - Make sure that only authorised individuals can access particular features by putting user authentication and authorisation methods in place.
   Verify user inputs to guard against security lapses and possible data manipulation.

8. Reporting: - Provide data and reports on the availability of books, borrower behaviour, and penalties accumulated.
